# The Google Resume

## Chapter 1: Introduction

- most other industries promote high performing employees into management
  - this doesn't have to be the case with engineers
  - can continue to get promotions and responsibilities without becoming a manager
  - eventually an architect or similar
- corporate culture can often be traced to the circumstances the company was founded

#### Startups
- startups (good)
  - small enough to not be able to fill every role, people tent to wear multiple hats
  - better leadership opportunities as company grows
  - feel like you are actually shaping the product, your contributions seem to matter more
  - faster results, don't have to wait years to see your work in the world - just months. This applies to everything though good and bad, every outcome is fast
  - high risk but high possible reward - can make you rich, can also do nothing for you
- startups (bad)
  - startup burnout is a real thing
  - long hours are critical
  - unclear job descriptions - may have to work on things outside of job description
  - low pay - tend to be below industry standard and compensate with stock options
  - if company fails (often does) stock options are worthless
  - limited credibility - a failed startup no one has heard o doesn't help you when looking for the next job
  - less mentorship - big companies invest and understand how to train, this lacks in a startup
- don't worry so much about perks - you tend to not miss them when they are gone, might be compensating for something
- fewer than 40% of startups make it past the first 4 years

#### What do you need?
- what is my dream job? job title? what do I want to do specifically
- what do you need? money? respect? work/life balance?
  - if you find yourself leaning away from a job ask why, is there something that you need that the job wouldn't provide?

#### How do you enjoy working?
- teamwork vs independent work - is this something you really enjoy?
- creating vs maintaining - how important is it to feel like you build something?
- leading vs joining - more responsibility vs more relaxed, leave risk to others

#### What are you good at?
- numbers - comes more easily to some than others
- writing and communication - being able to communicate effectively, both speaking and writing
- creativity - how you solve problems
- people skills - being likable, being able to read people, encourage them, know when pushing too hard
- **most people's college majors have little to do with their career path**, don't feel constrained by this. 
  - analyze actual successes and failures, think about project where you've been happy or unhappy, what made the difference
  
#### And you're on your way...
- it's nice to prepare a document to facilitate someone else taking your responsibilities when you leave
  - current progress, challenges, relationships with external partners

## Chapter 2: Advanced Preparation

#### What can you do: an overview
- recruiters want to know two things when they look at your resume
  - where would you fit at our company?
  - would you do a good job?
- if a recruiter can't identify answers to these then your resume goes in the garbage
- **your goal is to get the experiences and background that will answer these questions**
- develop a track record of achievement - want to see pattern of setting ambitious goals and accomplishing them
- learn to write and speak
  - if you aren't comfortable with public speaking get practice
  - if writing is weak take a class or start a blog
- emphasize depth over breadth
- become a leader - doesn't have to be big, just show you can lead
- find a mentor (or become one) - find someone who is 5 years ahead of you and get advice, could connect with opportunities
- develop a tangible skill - ex: if you want to be in marketing - learn about marketing
- learn about technology - **start reading sites like TechCrunch and CNET as well as company specific blogs**

#### Academics
- academia is just _one_ way to distinguish yourself, not necessary

#### Elite schools: what's in a name?
- may not help you get in the door, but may make it easier to get noticed

#### Picking your curriculum: majors, minors and other courses
- this does matter, may make it easier to get in the door
- the more directly applicable the better
- computer science is better than history, I'm probably somewhere in the middle
- **think about and remember the projects you've worked on**
  - interviewers will ask lots of questions about projects you've worked on, problems you had during these and how you solved them
  - **they don't want to know that you're smart, they don't want to know that you're fast, they want to know you can solve problems and produce results**

#### Grade point average: does it matter and what can you do?
- google is a little snobby for generally considering candidates with at least a 3.7 gpa
- top companies look for the top candidates - people with a track record of success, gpa is one point on this graph, but there are other points
- companies care about what you can actually do and your interview performance is generally a better indication than gpa

#### Work Experience
- might want to think bosses are your best advocates but they have their own agenda
- while you can usually trust your boss with having the best intentions there are limits to this
- you are your best advocate

#### Maker an Impact
a good employee does everything that is assigned to them, a great one asks for more
- think broadly - try to build things that help out others, better peer reviews
- be really good at what you do - shut off distractions or be extra careful
- solicit feedback proactively - don't wait until reviews for this, get frequently
- learn about other teams - if you're a dev, learn about what project managers do, even a little exposure will go a long way, it will show what different roles do and how they fit togeher

#### Become a generalist
- the best pm, marketers and developers have something in common - they understand each other's roles
- start from your role and work outwards
  - get lunch with people, ask them about their role, how do they make decisions, what do they do day to day
  
#### Size matters: quantify your impact
- **no matter how happy you are with your current job, with any luck it will be a stepping stone to a new position or a new company**
- all time at job gets condensed into about 5 bullets
- what goes in the bullets should be planned while working, not after you leave - work to add good stuff to it

#### Part-time jobs and internships
- having an "interesting" job early on can pay off (internship)

#### Extracurriculars and the checkbox people

#### Volunteering

#### Start something
- a great way to boost odds of an interview (depending on scale, committment, etc..)
- if you've got time to spare consider these:
  - launch a business - **mention censorpro maybe?**
  - write a blog - shows writing skills and increases net presence. updated at least every week or two, be diligent.
  - start a club or organization

#### Your questions answered
- your facebook profile is a good reflection of who you are and what employers want to learn about you
- don't necessarily delete pictures of you drinking (this is good for tech companies really) **but be mindful about how pictures represent you, remove those that represent you in a bad light**
  - you're doing something offensive - racist or sexist stuff will get you rejected
  - you're doing something illegal, dangerous or stupid - like really bad stuff
  - your interviewers think like your parents - my parents would think drunk pictures on facebook would be unprofessional, some interviewers may think the same thing
- maybe look on odesk.com, elance.com or rentacoder.com some some little side gigs that can go on resume
