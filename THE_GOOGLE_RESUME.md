# The Google Resume

## Chapter 1: Introduction

- most other industries promote high performing employees into management
  - this doesn't have to be the case with engineers
  - can continue to get promotions and responsibilities without becoming a manager
  - eventually an architect or similar
- corporate culture can often be traced to the circumstances the company was founded

#### Startups
- startups (good)
  - small enough to not be able to fill every role, people tent to wear multiple hats
  - better leadership opportunities as company grows
  - feel like you are actually shaping the product, your contributions seem to matter more
  - faster results, don't have to wait years to see your work in the world - just months. This applies to everything though good and bad, every outcome is fast
  - high risk but high possible reward - can make you rich, can also do nothing for you
- startups (bad)
  - startup burnout is a real thing
  - long hours are critical
  - unclear job descriptions - may have to work on things outside of job description
  - low pay - tend to be below industry standard and compensate with stock options
  - if company fails (often does) stock options are worthless
  - limited credibility - a failed startup no one has heard o doesn't help you when looking for the next job
  - less mentorship - big companies invest and understand how to train, this lacks in a startup
- don't worry so much about perks - you tend to not miss them when they are gone, might be compensating for something
- fewer than 40% of startups make it past the first 4 years

#### What do you need?
- what is my dream job? job title? what do I want to do specifically
- what do you need? money? respect? work/life balance?
  - if you find yourself leaning away from a job ask why, is there something that you need that the job wouldn't provide?

#### How do you enjoy working?
- teamwork vs independent work - is this something you really enjoy?
- creating vs maintaining - how important is it to feel like you build something?
- leading vs joining - more responsibility vs more relaxed, leave risk to others

#### What are you good at?
- numbers - comes more easily to some than others
- writing and communication - being able to communicate effectively, both speaking and writing
- creativity - how you solve problems
- people skills - being likable, being able to read people, encourage them, know when pushing too hard
- **most people's college majors have little to do with their career path**, don't feel constrained by this. 
  - analyze actual successes and failures, think about project where you've been happy or unhappy, what made the difference
  
#### And you're on your way...
- it's nice to prepare a document to facilitate someone else taking your responsibilities when you leave
  - current progress, challenges, relationships with external partners

## Chapter 2: Advanced Preparation

#### What can you do: an overview
- recruiters want to know two things when they look at your resume
  - where would you fit at our company?
  - would you do a good job?
- if a recruiter can't identify answers to these then your resume goes in the garbage
- **your goal is to get the experiences and background that will answer these questions**
- develop a track record of achievement - want to see pattern of setting ambitious goals and accomplishing them
- learn to write and speak
  - if you aren't comfortable with public speaking get practice
  - if writing is weak take a class or start a blog
- emphasize depth over breadth
- become a leader - doesn't have to be big, just show you can lead
- find a mentor (or become one) - find someone who is 5 years ahead of you and get advice, could connect with opportunities
- develop a tangible skill - ex: if you want to be in marketing - learn about marketing
- learn about technology - **start reading sites like TechCrunch and CNET as well as company specific blogs**

#### Academics
- academia is just _one_ way to distinguish yourself, not necessary

#### Elite schools: what's in a name?
- may not help you get in the door, but may make it easier to get noticed

#### Picking your curriculum: majors, minors and other courses
- this does matter, may make it easier to get in the door
- the more directly applicable the better
- computer science is better than history, I'm probably somewhere in the middle
- **think about and remember the projects you've worked on**
  - interviewers will ask lots of questions about projects you've worked on, problems you had during these and how you solved them
  - **they don't want to know that you're smart, they don't want to know that you're fast, they want to know you can solve problems and produce results**

#### Grade point average: does it matter and what can you do?
- google is a little snobby for generally considering candidates with at least a 3.7 gpa
- top companies look for the top candidates - people with a track record of success, gpa is one point on this graph, but there are other points
- companies care about what you can actually do and your interview performance is generally a better indication than gpa

#### Work Experience
- might want to think bosses are your best advocates but they have their own agenda
- while you can usually trust your boss with having the best intentions there are limits to this
- you are your best advocate

#### Maker an Impact
a good employee does everything that is assigned to them, a great one asks for more
- think broadly - try to build things that help out others, better peer reviews
- be really good at what you do - shut off distractions or be extra careful
- solicit feedback proactively - don't wait until reviews for this, get frequently
- learn about other teams - if you're a dev, learn about what project managers do, even a little exposure will go a long way, it will show what different roles do and how they fit togeher
 
#### Become a generalist
- the best pm, marketers and developers have something in common - they understand each other's roles
- start from your role and work outwards
  - get lunch with people, ask them about their role, how do they make decisions, what do they do day to day
  
#### Size matters: quantify your impact
- **no matter how happy you are with your current job, with any luck it will be a stepping stone to a new position or a new company**
- all time at job gets condensed into about 5 bullets
- what goes in the bullets should be planned while working, not after you leave - work to add good stuff to it

#### Part-time jobs and internships
- having an "interesting" job early on can pay off (internship)

#### Extracurriculars and the checkbox people

#### Volunteering

#### Start something
- a great way to boost odds of an interview (depending on scale, committment, etc..)
- if you've got time to spare consider these:
  - launch a business - **mention censorpro maybe?**
  - write a blog - shows writing skills and increases net presence. updated at least every week or two, be diligent.
  - start a club or organization

#### Your questions answered
- your facebook profile is a good reflection of who you are and what employers want to learn about you
- don't necessarily delete pictures of you drinking (this is good for tech companies really) **but be mindful about how pictures represent you, remove those that represent you in a bad light**
  - you're doing something offensive - racist or sexist stuff will get you rejected
  - you're doing something illegal, dangerous or stupid - like really bad stuff
  - your interviewers think like your parents - my parents would think drunk pictures on facebook would be unprofessional, some interviewers may think the same thing
- maybe look on odesk.com, elance.com or rentacoder.com some some little side gigs that can go on resume

## Chapter 3: Getting in the Door

SKIPPING FOR NOW

## Chapter 4: Resumes
- a good resume highlights a canidate's relevant skills
- must present candidate in a good light - it's the first chance for the job

#### Six hallmarks of a powerful resume
- every line should contribute to the employer's wanting to hire you
- skip the fluff
- before submitting - go through each line, ask yourself why it would help convince an employer to hire you, if it can't give a reason it probably shouldn't be there

##### 1. Accomplishment oriented
- shouldn't read too much like a job description
- should highlight what you did, not what you were supposed to do
  - **responsibility oriented** "analyzed new markets and explored potential entrance strategies for china division"
  - **accomplishment oriented** "led entrance strategy for blah product in china, and successfully persuaded CEO to refocus division on the enterprise market, resulting in a 7 percent increate in profits"
- accomplishment oriented packs a much stronger punch
- everyone wants an employee who "gets things done"
- watch out for things like "contributed to", "participated in" or "helped out with" - they show that you are more focused on responsibilities than accomplishments
  - imagine someone at microsoft saying they "contributed to the implimentation of microsoft office"

##### 2. Quantifiable Results
- if you really "reduced server latency" then why can't you tell them how much
- makes results more meaningful by showing the impact you had
  - if you implemented a change that reduced the company costs or increased profits the employers will want to hire you
- in tech it's good to quantify in more technical terms - seconds of latency, number of bugs, etc..
  - strike a balance, should be understandable to HR, not just fellow engineers
- "implemented crash reporter and used results to fix the biggest causes of crashes" -> "implemented crash reporter and used results to fix three biggest causes of crashes, leading to a 45 percent reduction in customer support calls"
- going from "you did something important" to "wow you really did something important"

##### 3. Well Targeted
- tailoring a resume to a position is a must
  - competition is higher and the customization is necessary to put your resume on the same playing field, or to stand out
- tailored to position and company
  - especially true for job switching - jumping from engineer -> team lead you should show leadership experience
  - ex: company is facing customer support issues - emphasise your prior experience in handling upset clients
- figuring out how to target resume is not hard
  - look at company's website or job description, ask yourself what their biggest issues are. Even if you don't have the skills for the exact issues, maybe you have the skills one would need to solve them

##### 4. Universally Meaningful
- stay away from technical jargon (both technical and non-technical)
- should be meaningful to recruiters as well as managers and teammates
- avoid acronyms, translate highly technical terminology to plain english
- explain impact or goals, particularly in a quantifiable way (this helps people understand your value)
- make sure everyone will get the "gist" of your resume

##### 5. Clean, Professional, Concise
- many recruiters will throw away a resume for a single typo (poor communication skills)
- tech companies are more forgiving, but still don't be sloppy
- check resume for the following:
  - conciseness - avoid large blocks of text (people hate reading and will skip paragraphs)
    - your resume should be a collection of bullets of 1-2 lines each
  - spelling - tip to check spelling - read resume backwards
  - grammar - have others review your resume for weird grammar
  - margins - ideally 1", no less than 0.75"
  - normal fonts - times new roman or arial, not smaller than 10pt
  - consistency - commas or semicolons to separate in a list, end a bullet with period or not, bold, underline, italics - these decisions aren't important but should be consistent
  - white space - use ample white space will make resume easy to read, crowded is straining
  - no first person - avoid using "I", "me" or "myself", use only third person throughout resume except with objective statement (if using one)
  
##### 6. Well Structured and Clear
- recruiters eyes jump to certain things - education, experience, technical skills, etc..
- remember that the path of least resistance for a recruiter is to throw away your resume - if they can't find what they are looking for they will toss it
- small formatting changes (EXAMPLE PAGE 63 CHART)
- decide what to emphasise, the role of the job vs the employer for example
- what will differentiate me the most from other applicants? will this get me in the yes pile?

#### The Structure
- there are other structures, but should generally stick to reverse chronological
- should have employement (or work experience), education, and optionally an objective, summary, technical skills or projects section
  - which sections to choose should be based on skills, background and desired position

#### The Objective
- these are rarely interesting (and shouldn't really be) and tend to waste space
- should only be used if it adds important information
  - such as the desire to switch roles, things to point recruiter in right direction (being a programmer and wanting a programming job doesn't need to be specified for example)
- most software engineers do not need an objective, experience is clear of the role and objective
- if you don't need to redirect to a new role, stick to a summary or list of key accomplishments instead
- objectives may prevent you from getting tangential jobs they may have considered you for

#### Summary (or Key Accomplishments)
- can wow the reader, but usually so vague that there is no impact
- should read more like key accomplishments
  - so much so that the section is often called "Summary and Key Accomplishments"
- demonstrate your value-add tot he prospective company (EXAMPLES PAGE 66 BULLETS)

#### Work Experience
- most important section of resume for most people
- at a minimum:
  - job title
  - company name
  - firm location
  - dates of employment
- most recent job should have 4-5 bullets of 1-2 lines each
  - each line shuld focus on accomplishments and backup up by numbers whenever possible
- can start by listing biggest accomplishments on a sheet of paper
  - make sure these are impressive to anybody, not just you or your own team
  
##### How Far Back Should It Go?
- only as far as the positions are relevant, no more than 3-5 jobs
- does not need to be a complete employment history

#### Projects
- software engineers with substantial nonwork experience should include a projects section (though this seems like it might be more for college students???)
- EXAMPLE PAGE 67 BLOCK

#### Education
- experience matters more than education
- education is a checkbox, but an important one
- should include:
  - university name
  - dates attended
  - location
  - major, minor and degree
    - if major has a nonstandard name you should explain the curriculum on the resume - and in a way that shapes the reader's perception
    - VERY GOOD TIME ARTS LIKE EXAMPLE PAGE 68 - U of Penn Digital Media Design (DMD) - "a computer science-based major with additional courses in design and communications"
      - maybe time arts could be something like "a computer science-based major with additional courses in art, design interaction and animation"
  - gpa
  - activities
    - not everything, just most impressive/relavant, more experienced candidates usually will not include activities
  - related coursework - current students/recent graduates mostly, probably not me
  - awards
- this section to get shorter with work experience
  - some candidates only list their major and degree
- high school almost never belongs on a resume
- work experience should be listed first, education later

#### Skills
- a must for technical positions
- list of any software, programming languages or specific skills you know
- avoid a length disorganized list - divide up into appropriate categories
- do not list obvious skills such as microsoft office - this is assumed
  - windows and mac can be left out unless also listing something less obvious like linux
- anything on your resume is fair game, remember you can be called out if you aren't honest about what you know

#### Awards and Honors
- in my case should be under education
- add description
  - "Recipient of Vincent R. Jacobs Award, given annually to the top woman by GPA out of 3,000 person senior class"
  - if you can quantify your award to suggest selectivity this is best
  
#### What Not to Include
- should never include race, religion, sexual preference, marital status or anything associated with discrimination
- pictures (which are indicitive of some of these) should not be included for this reason
- these pieces of information expose a company to increased liability
